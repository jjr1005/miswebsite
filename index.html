			Durham House of Pets was founded by Jess Roselund in 2002. Growing up, Jess had 5 dogs, 2 cats and 3 birds and always knew that she had a passion for animals. In June 2002, she started to create her own pet store. It started off very small where she would only sell her homemade dog treats, but now it has opened up to a wide variety of products including pet foods, toys and needs.
